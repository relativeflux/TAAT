# Welcome to the TAAT Docs

Welcome to the documentation pages for TAAT, the Tape Archive Analysis Toolkit.

Here you will find comprehensive documentation for the project's software outputs, including [installation instructions](user-guide.md/#installation), [guidance on usage](user-guide.md/#basic-usage), [tutorials](tutorials.md) and an [API reference](reference.md).

The project is the work of a small research team at the University of Huddersfield, including Dr Sam Gillies (project lead), and Dr Christopher Melen (main software developer), with invaluable contributions from Dr Alex Harker and Prof Monty Adkins.
